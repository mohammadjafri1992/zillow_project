# Real estate website - A clone of Zillow.com

This website is a clone project of a popular property research and trading platform, Zillow.com. Zillow.com is a real estate website which facilitates buying and selling of owenership and rental properties accross the US and Canada.

My project, [Zillow Clone Website](http://159.65.186.95 "Zillow Clone Homepage"), is a clone of the popular website and supports all the basic requirements of a real estate website. The website is currently live on DigitalOcaean.

### Project Description
The project was built with Python Django and contains the following Django Apps:

1. Listings
2. Realtors
3. User Registeration
4. Contacts
5. Accounts

#### User Registration
In the website, the users can register and create their own accounts. They can look at all the available listings provided by the admin superuser. 

If a user wants to contact the realtor for a specific property, the user can fill out an enquiry form and an email will be sent to the realtor about the enquiry with the name, email and contact information of the user. This functionality has been deactivated to save hosting costs. The code exists on the server.

Users can only contact a realtor about a property only once. If a user tries to enquire about a property more than once, an error message will appear and his request will not be forwarded. This activity can be monitored by the admin user through the backend. 

All the properties that a user has enquired about show up in the user dashboard.
